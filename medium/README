Here lists some useful CMake commands.


if
____________________________________________________________________________
	This is the most important command in CMake scripts. It can
	do string or version comparison for us, and also checks the
	existance of file or directory.


sub_routime
____________________________________________________________________________
	This example mainly contains function, macro and foreach
	commands. 


file
____________________________________________________________________________
	Simple file operations like Read, Write, Append.


string
____________________________________________________________________________
	String processing is another important command to learn.
	For a script language, string processing is hard to avoid,
	because almost everything in CMake can be expressed as
	string. Regular expression comparison also gives helps to
	advanced users.


get_filename_component
____________________________________________________________________________
	Users may face a condition to get some infomation from a
	file name, like getting directory of certain file or
	getting extension from a file. CMake can handle this for you.


test
____________________________________________________________________________
	Programer must write tests to assert the hehavior of the
	program is correct.  This example shows how to create tests
	for CTest. CTest will do all the tests for you and print
	results in a highly readable format.



find_package
____________________________________________________________________________
	Users usually needs external libraries and want to find out
	where it exists.  For some popular libraries, you are not
	necessary to write a finding script by yourself. CMake has
	builtin Finding scripts for you. This example tells you how to
	create a simple QT4 program with CMake.


find_something
____________________________________________________________________________
	On configure stage, users often want to know whether a program
	exists and where it is. CMake provides some handy FindXXX
	commands for users. FindXXX commands returns the full name or
	XXX-NOTFOUND if finds nothing. It is easy to check the existance
	of necessary objects(programs, libraries, files and paths).


execute_process
____________________________________________________________________________
	This command allows users to execute command from your shell.
	Note that this example relies on find_program() command, users
	are suggested to know find_program() before using this example.
	Caution : Using commands from your shell may make dependency
	to the commands, thus result a non-portable CMake script.
